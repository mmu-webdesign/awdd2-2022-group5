### Issues

Originally, we found the site wasn't correct in the initial browser. As you can tell from the screenshots, the border around the logo in the center wasn't correct at first. We then changed this, updated the site and tried again. We then achieved our desired outcome and the browsr looked correct as expected, screenshot of the correct version below.

### Emilly's Persona

From our research, Emillys persona as a young girl, used her iphone browser to access our site. Emilly doesn't use a laptop and uses her iphone for everything. This derived from our research as the site needed to be easy for Emilly to access on her iphone.

**Repeat to show at least on IOS and Android. Use actual phone screenshots, not desktop browsers resized or emulators**.
