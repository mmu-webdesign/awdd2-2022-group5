Our team discussed what could be done to further develop our website. As we have all learnt a lot of new skills while coding this website, we discussed features we have seen on competitor and inspirational websites that already exist. We discussed that if we had to develop the website further, we would be required to deepen our skillset. Features such as an interactive chatbot, interactive appointment booking feature with our team, and a general health quiz. An interactive chatbot requires a database of questions and answers to be created, stored, and then embedded into our website as a pop up, that users can interact with if they wish. The health appointment booking feature would ask users to share their general location, and from that information present the user with doctors, hospitals and surgeries near them and their availability, if an appointment can be booked online or over the phone, again this feature would require a database to be put together of the locations in the UK to pull this information forward. For UK users only. It would also indicate if the appointment is with a public or private professional. Finally, we discussed the idea of a general health quiz, for users to take who may not know if they need to seek help for an issue or generally want to check in with their health to better their judgement. This would ask general health questions and provide suggestions of next steps, based on the answers the user provides.
