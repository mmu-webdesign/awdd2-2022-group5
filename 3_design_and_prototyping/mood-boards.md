Explain how your personal influences and inspirations for this moodboard: 
The first moodboard above begins by exploring the reality of working out in a gym, and how your physical fitness can be explored and improved by being in a building, surrounded by other people, and with all the equipment needed (if comfortable with it) to use as people like. PureGym is an example of a Gym that is very well known in the UK and a good indication of what a physcial gym looks like to the users visiting our website who may have never been to a gym before and are looking for advice. Puregym's website is a great example of a fitness company promoting their brand and using a modern look0-and-feel to engage users, colours such as bright turquoise and yellow are contrasting, however this makes the contnt and images pop and appear 3D on the screen. Puregym's website uses vertical scrolling, however the website is sectioned horiozontally allowing for clean cuts and distinctions betweeen the sections. The colours picked out have been taken as inspiration for what we could use on our wesbite, from the graphics and the types of colours used in photography. as the moodboard focuses on the them of working out and fitness, logos and graphics ahve also been pulled to act as inspiration of what is already out there for when we design our own, knowing what we can not copy from others. The moodboard is followed by images that showcase the option of working out at home, as for some users this may be their preferred choice. Colours have also been pulled from graphics that have been designed to be in place of images, colours like blue and green are familiar in this theme.

Explain how your personal influences and inspirations for this moodboard: Another section of our website will inclusde information and how-to-guides about healthy eating. colours that are repeating within existing health eating themed images, graphics and icons are red, green and orange - these are colours that have been pulled out and will be taken into account when creating the colour palette in the style guide for the website. The style of healthy eating we will focus on will be general, well-known advice, but we will also cater our how-to-guides on healthy eating around eating to build muscle / lose weight for the users who require this, hence why we have explored images that communicate the strategy of meal preparartion. for this section, exploring the use of icons, and looking for some designs that provide information, is key to help us communicate correctly using communication methods that isn't solely text.
