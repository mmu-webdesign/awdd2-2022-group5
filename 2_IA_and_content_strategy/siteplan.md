### Commentary
You have established this architecture following the card sort and tree testing. Explain the architecture that we now see.

After completing a card sorting activity to brainstorm with the team, and utilising the layout elements and style provided by the practise of tree testing, we have been able to establish the relationships between the categories we will have on our website. All content on the site map is labelled with the titles/sub-titles, or the names that the user will see, of the interactive buttons we will use. The architecture of the website has the homepage/landing page at the top of the diagram as this is accessed through the primary link to the website. Followed by the navigation pannel, 3 sub-headings/sub-pages for content which follows from the pre-determined internal links (located in the navigation), taking you to one of three subpages within our site, and finally the footer.

>We would expect at least one further iteration, but don't adjust them for the sake of it. Your final version must reflect the architecture of the site (The Guide) that you submit at SP5.
