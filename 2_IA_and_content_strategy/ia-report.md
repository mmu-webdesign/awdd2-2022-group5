Please find listed below the categories we shared and the results of the most popular card sort.


### List of the card elements

## Tree testing

### Introduction

No that we had an architecture ywe liked, we tested it out with a tree testing exercise, initially on paper before using the Optimal Workshop Treejack (online).

### Illustration of the architecture tested

### Tree testing results

Given that a website's architecture is incredibly important for both user experience and SEO, we believe the tree testing exercise confirmed our choice of our website structuring strategy, with the aims of improving dwell time and encouraging our users to consume more of your content and explore all aspects of the site - rather than just reading one section.
