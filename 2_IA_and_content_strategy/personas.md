### Name of persona - Julie Walters
The persona of Julie was derived from the results of our user research which indicated that mature women aspire to rejuvinate their physcial health and regain the fittness levels they previous had. The research also indicated that many women after having children, or even grandchildren, struggle to find the time to go to the gym or workout from home, which was important to their wellbeing. We also wanted to capture the wellbeing needs of disabled people in this persona, as they are often overlooked as the target audience for physical health campaigns, and therefore we wanted our website to cater for people of all abilities. The persona of Julie, an elderly woman in a wheelchair, is the type of profile we want to appeal to and support their often unmet needs but other wellbeing and fittness sites.
