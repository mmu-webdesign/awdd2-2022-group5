## Primary audience(s)

_A short overview of target users (reflecting your user personas and user journeys). This might include age, gender, education, occupation, income, preferred OS, browser, computer device, and internet skill level. What are the audience goals? What does the audience want and need_?

The target audience of this project is inviduals who are seeking to live a healthier lifestyle, however they are new to this realm and therefore, they have limited knowledge and little idea of where to start.

In terms of our audience's demographic, it varies from teenagers still at school through to parents and everyday working inviduals. We beleive that living a healthy lifestyle is not subject to age or one's background as we believe it is something that everybody should strive for. However, it is important that our target auidence has a genuine interest in persuing a healthier way of living. 

## Branding/perception

_Corporate design considerations (logo, branding, etc.), abstract qualities (friendly, professional, approachable, etc.), personality (that the site reflects or embodies), key visual attributes (colour, graphic style, etc.), language (professional, informal or instructional, etc.). How will the site deliver the desired perception_?

The language of the website is intended to be friendly, approachable, easy to read and ensuring that the reader is not overwhelmed as we intend for the content to be easy to digest and not complicated. In addition, the tone used will be very informal and instructional as this is a how to guide and targeted at beginners 
The visual attributes of our site are intended to be bright and colourful to capture the user’s full attention. We intend to use images and graphics to help portray a similar tone to what we want to convey with the language. 


## Communication strategy

_What are the primary messages you want to convey to the target audience? What makes your guide unique? What can you do that other guides can&#39;t? Briefly explain how the new site will convey the primary messages_.

The primary messages of our website are; how one can better than physical and mental health and how none can improve their lifestyle choices through diet. 

Our guide is unique as it isn't aimed at one demographic, it is aimed at all inviduals with the sole intention of improving their life but without any prior experience, compared to other guides which are targeted at inviduals who are already experienced with going to the gym, eating healthy and improving their mental health. 

The site will be structured as a how to guide, with simple and easy to follow steps. In addition, our guide will be very informal but still informative in order to maintain the user's attention. Furthermore, our website will be very visual and engaging.
